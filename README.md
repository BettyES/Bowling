## Bowling Game

Count and sum the scores of a bowling game of one player.

### Rules of play
A game of bowling consists of ten frames. In each frame, the bowler will have two chances to knock down as many 
pins as possible with their bowling ball. In games with more than one bowler, as is common, every bowler will 
take their frame in a predetermined order before the next frame begins. If a bowler is able to knock down all 
ten pins with the first ball, they are awarded a strike. If the bowler is able to knock down all 10 pins with the 
two balls of a frame, it is known as a spare. Bonus pins are awarded for both of these, depending on what is 
scored in the next two balls (for a strike) or one ball (for a spare). The bowler is allowed to throw two extra 
balls for achieving a strike in the tenth frame, or one extra ball for achieving a spare. This allows for a 
potential of 12 strikes in a single game, and a maximum score of 300 pins, a perfect game. The player with the 
highest pinfall at the end of ten frames wins. Although, if there is a time limit and if time runs out before 
the end of ten frames bowling stops, and the person with the highest pinfall wins the game. 

In general, one point is scored for each pin that is knocked over. So if a player bowls over three pins with 
the first shot, then six with the second, the player would receive a total of nine pins for that frame. If a 
player knocks down nine pins with the first shot, but misses with the second, the player would also score nine. 
When a player fails to knock down all ten pins after their second ball it is known as an open frame.

Strike: When all ten pins are knocked down with the first ball (called a strike and typically rendered as an
"X" on a scoresheet), a player is awarded ten pins, plus a bonus of whatever is scored with the next two balls. 
In this way, the pinfall scored for the two balls after the strike are counted twice.

Spare: A "spare" is awarded when no pins are left standing after the second ball of a frame; i.e., a player 
uses both balls of a frame to clear all ten pins. A player achieving a spare is awarded ten pins, plus a bonus 
of whatever is scored with the next ball (only the first ball is counted). It is typically rendered as a slash 
on scoresheets in place of the second pin count for a frame.
